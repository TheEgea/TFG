%\section{Problem Statement and Educational Gap}

Cybersecurity education faces a critical challenge: the disconnect between 
theoretical knowledge of IT systems and practical understanding of how 
security failures manifest in integrated environments. While students in 
the Computer Engineering degree program learn fundamental concepts---databases, 
network protocols, operating system internals, and software architecture---they 
rarely experience how misconfigurations and design flaws in these domains 
directly translate to security vulnerabilities.

Current training approaches amplify this gap. Commercial platforms such as 
HackTheBox and TryHackMe focus on isolated challenge-based scenarios that 
abstract away system complexity. Professional pentesting certifications 
(e.g., CEH, OSCP\cite{ceh_framework, oscp_exam}) expect hands-on experience in realistic environments, yet 
many academic programs struggle to provide such environments due to cost, 
complexity, or vendor lock-in.

Within the TecnoCampus Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering 
(Management and Information Systems track), the ``Introduction to Cybersecurity'' 
course currently lacks a structured, reusable, and automatable lab environment that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Aligns pentesting scenarios with specific degree learning outcomes
    \item Enables students to recognize vulnerabilities within integrated systems 
          (not isolated exploits)
    \item Provides reproducible environments for consistent assessment
    \item Reduces instructor workload through automation and documentation
    \item Remains cost-effective and institution-independent (open-source, 
          locally maintained)
\end{itemize}

\section{The Pedagogical Disconnect}

Ethical hacking, or pentesting, has become a critical skill in today's cybersecurity 
landscape. With the increasing reliance on virtualized environments, there is a growing 
need for practical training platforms that simulate real-world scenarios. However, current 
educational approaches present a significant challenge: while platforms such as HackTheBox\cite{hackthebox} 
and TryHackMe\cite{tryhackme} have become increasingly popular for cybersecurity training, they often focus 
on isolated challenges and gamified scenarios that may not directly reflect the practical 
application of computer science fundamentals taught in a degree program.

This educational disconnect manifests in several ways:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Theory-to-Practice Gap:} Students learn databases, networks, and operating 
systems in isolation. They rarely experience how misconfigurations in these foundational 
systems translate to security vulnerabilities exploitable in real-world attacks.

\item \textbf{Tool-Centric Rather Than Methodology-Centric Learning:} Commercial platforms 
teach tool usage (``how to use Nmap'') rather than systematic penetration testing methodologies 
(``how to conduct reconnaissance'').

\item \textbf{Fragmented Learning Paths:} No comprehensive platform integrates multiple 
pentesting domains (reconnaissance --> web vulnerabilities --> network analysis --> privilege 
escalation) while maintaining alignment with specific degree curricula.

\item \textbf{Institutional Dependencies:} External platforms introduce vendor lock-in, 
limit customization, and reduce institutional control over assessment and content evolution.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Description and Scope}

This Final Degree Project develops a comprehensive, reusable teaching package 
of cybersecurity practical laboratories using EVE-NG (Emulated Virtual 
Environment - Next Generation) that directly addresses the identified gaps. 
The package is designed for the ``Introduction to Cybersecurity'' course 
within the Computer Engineering degree program.

\section{Deliverables}

The project consists of creating four structured virtualized labs covering 
primary pentesting domains:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reconnaissance and Enumeration}: Network scanning, service 
          identification, and information gathering using industry-standard 
          tools (Nmap)
    
    \item \textbf{Web Application Vulnerabilities}: Practical exploitation 
          of OWASP Top 10\cite{owasp2021} categories within controlled, intentionally 
          vulnerable web applications
    
    \item \textbf{Network Traffic Analysis and Cryptography}: Packet capture 
          analysis using Wireshark, protocol dissection, and 
          encryption/decryption scenarios
    
    \item \textbf{Privilege Escalation}: Techniques for escalating privileges 
          on Unix/Linux and Windows systems, reflecting real-world 
          post-exploitation scenarios
\end{enumerate}

Each lab includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete network topologies with preconfigured virtual machines
    \item Automated deployment and reset scripts for efficient lab lifecycle management
    \item Technical documentation detailing network design, vulnerability 
          implementation, and remediation
    \item Student learning guides with structured objectives and self-assessment rubrics
    \item Assessment materials for instructors to evaluate lab completion 
          and skill acquisition
\end{itemize}


\section{Why EVE-NG? Selection Rationale}

The selection of EVE-NG as the platform is justified through comparative 
analysis of alternatives and specific alignment with project requirements.

\section{Alignment with Computer Engineering Degree}

This project creates an explicit connection between four core competencies 
taught throughout the degree program and their direct application to cybersecurity:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Programming and Software Development}: Labs demonstrate how 
          insecure coding practices (SQL injection, buffer overflows, improper 
          input validation) lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. Students 
          recognize that defensive programming is not an afterthought but a 
          core software engineering practice.
    
    \item \textbf{Software Engineering}: Network topologies and application 
          architectures in labs embody both secure and insecure design patterns. 
          Students analyze architectural decisions (monolithic vs. microservices, 
          authentication mechanisms, data separation) and observe their security 
          implications.
    
    \item \textbf{Systems and Information Engineering}: Labs integrate multiple 
          systems (databases, web servers, network services, operating systems) 
          in realistic configurations, reflecting how SI engineers must consider 
          threat landscapes when designing enterprise solutions.
    
    \item \textbf{Computer Architecture and Networks}: Privilege escalation labs 
          explore OS-level vulnerabilities, memory management flaws, and network 
          protocol weaknesses that emerge from architectural design decisions 
          taught in prerequisite courses.
\end{enumerate}

By demonstrating how theoretical knowledge directly maps to security vulnerabilities, 
this project transforms abstract concepts into concrete, experiential learning outcomes.


\subsection{Pedagogical Importance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theory-to-Practice Bridge}: Pentesting labs create the missing 
          link between theoretical coursework and professional-grade practical 
          experience
    
    \item \textbf{Active Learning}: Hands-on vulnerability discovery and 
          exploitation is more engaging and memorable than passive lectures 
          or textbook study
    
    \item \textbf{Professional Preparation}: Students gain experience with 
          industry-standard tools (Kali Linux, Metasploit, Wireshark) and 
          methodologies (OWASP, CIS Controls), directly preparing them for 
          professional roles
    
    \item \textbf{Assessment and Competency Verification}: Structured labs 
          with clear objectives and rubrics enable objective assessment of 
          student competency in cybersecurity fundamentals
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Course Enhancement}: The ``Introduction to Cybersecurity'' 
          course gains a modern, practical component that improves student 
          satisfaction and learning outcomes
    
    \item \textbf{Reduced Instructor Burden}: Automation scripts and comprehensive 
          documentation minimize preparation time, enabling instructors to focus 
          on learning support rather than lab administration
    
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility}: Consistent lab environments ensure fair 
          assessment across multiple course sections and cohorts
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability and Sustainability}: The reusable package can serve 
          multiple offerings of the course and potentially be adapted for related 
          courses in the degree program or distributed to other institutions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Professional Context}

The cybersecurity industry demands professionals who understand both attack and 
defense across integrated systems. Practitioners must:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Recognize vulnerabilities within complex, heterogeneous environments 
          (not isolated systems)
    \item Apply defensive practices informed by knowledge of real attack methodologies
    \item Operate with professional ethics and legal compliance 
          (ethical hacking mindset)
    \item Use industry-standard tools and frameworks (OWASP, CIS, NIST)
\end{itemize}

This project prepares students to meet these professional expectations by 
providing realistic, integrated training environments.
