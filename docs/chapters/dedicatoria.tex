\subsection{Acknowledgments}

\subsubsection*{Institutional Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my tutor, Pere Vidiella i Catalan,
 for his guidance, trust, and constructive feedback throughout this project.
  I am also deeply grateful to the faculty and staff of the Computer Engineering program
   for providing the academic framework, resources, and supportive environment that made
    this work possible. Their dedication to excellence in teaching and mentoring has been
     instrumental in shaping both the technical scope and the academic rigor of this thesis.

\subsubsection*{Personal Acknowledgments}
This thesis is dedicated, above all, to my grandmother,
 who passed away just before I began my degree—shortly after my university admission
  and the day before my English examination. Choosing to write this thesis in English is, in part,
   a meaningful way to close a chapter that marked the beginning of my university journey without the person
    who meant the most to me and who, in many ways, was like a mother to me.
\\I am also profoundly grateful to my friends, my partner, and my partner’s family for their unwavering support
 and encouragement, especially during the most difficult moments of my studies, including a period when I faced a serious
  health challenge that could have left me paralyzed. Their presence, care, and belief in me have been essential to completing
   this work.


\subsection{Personal Reflection}
The completion of this Bachelor's Thesis has been an enriching experience that has allowed me to deepen my knowledge of cybersecurity and develop technical and project management skills.
I have learned the importance of practice in learning this discipline and how virtualized environments can facilitate this process.
This project has motivated me to continue exploring the field of cybersecurity and to contribute to the training of future professionals in this critical area.
