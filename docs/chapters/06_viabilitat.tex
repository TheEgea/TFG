\chapter{Budget}

\section{Cost of Human Resources}

The total estimated effort for the bachelor's thesis is \textbf{820 hours}, corresponding to the 20 ECTS credits
 assigned to the subject (25 hours per ECTS). The distribution is as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|r|r|r|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Hours} & \textbf{Hourly Rate} & \textbf{Total Cost} \\
    \hline
    Phase 0: Preparation & 105h & 15 \euro/h & 1,575 \euro \\
    Phase 1: Avantprojecte & 188h & 15 \euro/h & 2,820 \euro \\
    Phase 2: Interim Report & 212h & 15 \euro/h & 3,180 \euro \\
    Phase 3: Final Delivery & 315h & 15 \euro/h & 4,725 \euro \\
    \hline

    \item \textbf{Inclusive Language}: All documentation (thesis, technical write-ups, student guides) uses gender-neutral language where possible, avoiding gender-biased assumptions.
    
    \item \textbf{Diverse Examples}: Laboratory scenarios and fictional user accounts employ diverse names and backgrounds, reflecting the multicultural and gender-diverse nature of the cybersecurity profession.
    
    \item \textbf{Accessibility}: Documentation is structured to be accessible to students with diverse learning needs, including clear formatting, descriptive headings, and optional use of dyslexia-friendly fonts (OpenDyslexic) in LaTeX template.
\end{itemize}

\section{Addressing the Gender Gap in Cybersecurity}

Cybersecurity remains a male-dominated field. This project contributes to bridging the gender gap:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accessible Entry Point}: Well-documented, structured laboratories lower barriers to entry for students traditionally underrepresented in technical fields, providing a supportive learning environment.
    
    \item \textbf{Ethical Framework}: Emphasizing the ethical aspects of cybersecurity (responsible disclosure, defensive security, societal impact) may appeal to a broader demographic beyond the stereotype of "hacker culture."
    
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Learning}: The design encourages collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing rather than competitive dynamics, fostering an inclusive learning culture.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}: The project demonstrates \textbf{awareness and commitment} to gender and diversity considerations, incorporating inclusive language, diverse representation, and accessibility measures that align with modern educational best practices.
